			<p>Late last year, vivo announced its X60 and X60 Pro phones in China powered by Samsung’s Exynos 1080 chipsets. So far both devices have remained exclusive to the Chinese market but yesterday we saw multiple certification listings and now we get more confirmation from the Google Play Console and a Geekbench listing. </p>
			<p>Listings for the vivo X60 (V2045) and X60 Pro (V2046) reveal the global variants will come with different hardware compared to their Chinese counterparts. The most notable change is the addition of the Snapdragon 870 chipset (SM 8250ac) in place of the Exynos 1080.  </p>
